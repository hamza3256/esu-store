## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

### **Next.js 14**
Next.js powers the frontend of the application, offering server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and an app directory-based routing system for scalability and performance.

### **TypeScript**
TypeScript enhances the development experience with type checking, helping reduce errors and improve code quality.

### **tRPC**
We leverage tRPC to create typesafe APIs with minimal boilerplate, simplifying the integration between the client and server.

### **Stripe**
Stripe is integrated for handling secure online payments, both for credit card transactions and for managing subscriptions and invoices.

### **TailwindCSS**
TailwindCSS is used to rapidly design modern, responsive UIs. It helps maintain a consistent design language across the app without writing custom CSS.

### **Shadcn**
Shadcn provides a set of pre-built, accessible components for the user interface. It ensures components are fully customizable while maintaining accessibility best practices.

### **Cloudinary**
Cloudinary is used for image hosting and optimization. All product images are served via Cloudinary, ensuring fast loading times and image transformations (resizing, compression, etc.).

### **Sonner**
Sonner is used for managing toasts and notifications, ensuring a smooth UX experience by providing user feedback during actions such as form submissions, checkout processes, and error handling.

### **Lucide Icons**
Lucide is used for iconography, adding clear, scalable vector icons to the UI for a modern and clean look.

### **Resend API**
Emails such as order confirmations and invoices are sent using Resend API, ensuring reliable and trackable email delivery.
